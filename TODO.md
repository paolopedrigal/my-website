## TODO:

- Start styling pages
- Make contact floating across all pages
- Create a loading screen for JUST the home page
- Add back image button for timeline event and project page

## New Notes:

- If dateEndMonth is "Present", dateEndYear is null

## Old Notes:

- Use `npm run deploy` when making changes to published website in main branch. (The gh-pages branch will automatically be pushed because of npm gh-pages?)
