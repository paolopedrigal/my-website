## TODO:

- Finish basic html/js for rest of the pages
- Create a loading screen for JUST the home page

## New Notes:

- If dateEndMonth is "Present", dateEndYear is null

## Old Notes:

- Use `npm run deploy` when making changes to published website in main branch. (The gh-pages branch will automatically be pushed because of npm gh-pages?)
